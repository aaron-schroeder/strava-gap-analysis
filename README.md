## How does the GAP algorithm work?

Good (current): upload synthetic data with constant speed and grade.

Better: Scrape the actual GAP data and investigate real-data relationship between SmoothGradeStream and (GradeAdjustedDistance, GradeAdjustedPace).
  - from the frontend
    - Heavyish lift possibly. So far I've only done this manually, but I'd only consider doing it for all activities if I got selenium/scrapy to do it. 
  - From the api
    - Streams not possible: no GAP stream provided
    - Summary data? I assume GAP is included if you pay, but I'm not sure.
